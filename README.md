### Hi there âœ¨

This is the github page aims to evaluate the effect of external borrowing using an integrated approach that combines propensity score and Bayesian dynamic borrowing methods. Users are encouraged to check the vigbette for detailed instructions.

Other projects:
- [CV in biomarker development](https://github.com/yichenlu47/simulation-2020): exploratory simulation to understand how different cross-validation methods impact the estimation of effect size
- [Maternal HIV in Kenya](https://github.com/yichenlu47/hiv_kenya): identify factors (e.g. timing of diagnosis) that significantly associate with maternal HIV status in Kenya. Adopted survey weights to compensate for over-sampling in dense regions and used a generalized estimating equation to account for correlation among viral load measures
