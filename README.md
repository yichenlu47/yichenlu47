### Hi there, I am Yichen âœ¨

I am a full-time student passionate about using data to improve quality of life for patients. I use this page to keep track of my past projects for school and interst. My work updates can be found on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yichenlu0416/">LinkedIn</a> ðŸ’¼

My homework and project code for previous coursework:
- [BIOST 514 Biostatistics I](https://github.com/yichenlu47/applied_biostatistics)
- [BIOST 515 Applied Biostatistics II: Introduction to Regression Analysis](https://github.com/yichenlu47/applied_biostatistics_regression_analysis)
- [BIOST 527 Nonparametric Regression and Classification](https://github.com/yichenlu47/nonparametric_regression_classification)
- [BIOST 561 Computational Skills for Biostatistics I](https://github.com/yichenlu47/computational_skills_biostatistics)


My programs for other projects:
- [Evaluate algorithm performance for colorectal cancer diagnosis](https://github.com/yichenlu47/uw_capstone_project)
  - team collaboration with Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center
  - calculate Kappa statistics and perform bootstrapping to evaluate the accuracy of an algorithm using administrative data to identify colorectal cancer participants in the Women's Health Initiative study
  - assess if the hazard ratios of colorectal cancer measured using Medicare-derived and WHI-adjudicated outcomes are comparable
  
- [CV in biomarker development](https://github.com/yichenlu47/simulation-2020)
  -  research project with Genentech
  -  exploratory simulation to understand how different cross-validation methods impact the estimation of effect size
  
- [Maternal HIV in Kenya](https://github.com/yichenlu47/hiv_kenya)
  - collaboration with UW and CDC Kenya 
  - identify factors (e.g. timing of diagnosis) that significantly associate with maternal HIV status in Kenya
  - adopte survey weights to compensate for over-sampling in dense regions
  - use a generalized estimating equation to account for correlation among viral load measures
